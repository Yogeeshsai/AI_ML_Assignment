Dataset Analysis and Preprocessing:

Download the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset.
Analyze the dataset structure and features.
Perform preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
# Code for dataset analysis and preprocessing
# This code should include loading the dataset, analyzing its structure, and performing preprocessing steps
Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for binary classification.
Implement the selected algorithm(s) using Python libraries like scikit-learn or pytorch.
Train the model(s) on the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Code for model development
# This code should include splitting the dataset, choosing algorithms, training models, and evaluating performance


Model Evaluation and Optimization:

Analyze the performance of the trained model(s) using evaluation metrics.
Explore techniques for model optimization such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or model ensemble methods.
Optimize the model parameters and evaluate the impact on model performance.
# Code for model evaluation and optimization
# This code should include evaluating model performance and optimizing model parameters
Documentation and Presentation:

Document the entire process including dataset analysis, preprocessing steps, model development, evaluation results, and optimization techniques used.
Prepare a concise report summarizing findings, insights gained, challenges encountered, and recommendations for reducing employee attrition.
Optionally, create a presentation to showcase your work, highlighting key steps, results, and conclusions.
